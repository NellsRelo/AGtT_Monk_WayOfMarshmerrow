# About
>>> One of the fastest growing Dunmeri martial arts, the Way of Marshmerrow is a relatively new creation, based on the teachings of Khajiit martial artists. Its teachings weave a practicioners willpower and spiritual essence with more traditional unarmed combat techniques. Monks of this tradition are capable of utilizing their Ki Points to cast spells if they already know how to use magic, and can otherwise create effects similar to traditional Illusion spells using only their actions.

Monks following the Way of Marshmerrow are a tricky bunch. They mix utility and support spells with their unarmed attacks, providing new and interesting playstyles for a budding martial artist.
